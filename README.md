# Secrets

## Description
* Project uses Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB
* I used this project to teach myself about user security, authentication, sessions, and cookies.
* I learned how to use Google auth 2.0 from passport.js to authenticate users with their Google account, as well as how to create a session so that users who have logged in previously don't have to log in again even after closing the window or browser. I also learned how to securely store a user's password using passport.js in a MongoDB database.
